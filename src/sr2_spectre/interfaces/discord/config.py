    Attributes:
        token: Discord bot token (required for a real connection; can be
               empty for tests that mock the bot client).
        channels: List of channel IDs to monitor. Empty list means all
                  text channels the bot has access to.
        mention_only: If True, only respond when the bot is mentioned
                      (via @BotName or <@BotID>). If False, respond to
                      every message in configured channels.
        max_message_length: Maximum length of a single Discord message
                            sent by the bot. Discord hard limit is 2000.
        edit_stream_interval: Seconds between message edits when
                              simulating streaming output. Set to 0 to
                              disable streaming edits (send one final
                              message instead).
        tool_embed_enabled: Whether to send tool execution updates as
                            Discord embeds.
