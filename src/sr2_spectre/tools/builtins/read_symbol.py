"""Read-symbol tool — extract a full type/function definition from source.

Grep returns matching lines; understanding a class or function needs its full
signature. This tool reads the definition block (class body, function header +
docstring + first code section) so an agent can see required fields, method
signatures, and type annotations before constructing an instance.

Designed to solve the grounding gap observed in bead obsidian-ye0: when an
agent needs to instantiate a Pydantic model or call a constructor, grep of a
single field name only returns that one line, not the full field list.
