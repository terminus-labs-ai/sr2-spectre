"""Spectre configuration models.

SpectreConfig is a superset of SR2's PipelineConfig:
  - agent:    spectre-owned concerns (name, tools, mcp_servers)
  - models:   dict[str, ModelConfig] — LLM endpoints
  - pipeline: SR2's native PipelineConfig — passed directly to SR2()

Public API (loaders):
  - load_resolved_config()        — 4-tier merge → dict (used by cli.resolve_config)
  - load_resolved_config_with_provenance() — 4-tier merge → (dict, provenance) (used by config show)
  - load_config_with_provenance() — tiers 1-3 merge → (dict, provenance) (used by config show)
  - load_merged_config()          — tiers 1-3 merge → dict (test-only; kept for tier-merge tests)
  - load_config()                 — single file → SpectreConfig (test-only; kept for mcp wiring tests)
