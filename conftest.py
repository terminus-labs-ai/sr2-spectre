"""Root-level pytest configuration.

Ensures compatibility between AsyncMock and asyncio.iscoroutinefunction()
across Python versions. In Python 3.11, AsyncMock sets _is_coroutine on
instances but not on the class itself. Test helpers that access
AsyncMock._is_coroutine as a class attribute fail without this shim.
